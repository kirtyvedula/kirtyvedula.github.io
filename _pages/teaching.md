#### [236781: Deep Learning](https://vistalab-technion.github.io/cs236781/semesters/w22/)

**Winter 2019--Spring 2022, CS Faculty, Technion.**

Was head TA of a graduate-level course which provides both the necessary
theoretical background and the hands-on experience required to be an effective
deep learning practitioner, or to start on the path towards deep learning
research. Since it was a new course at the time, I created and maintained all
the tutorials and homework assignment materials.
