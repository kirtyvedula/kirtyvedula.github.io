I'm a PhD student in the [VISTA Lab](https://vista.cs.technion.ac.il) at the
Technion [Computer Science Faculty](https://cs.technion.ac.il), advised by
Prof. [Alex Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il). I am also a machine
learning engineer and data scientist at [Sibylla](https://sibylla.ai), where I
lead the design and implementation of our ML platform.

My research focuses on implementing machine learning tools for practical use in
medicine and biology, including modeling and analysis of heart rate
variability, detection of abnormalities in ECG signals, statistical methods
such as conformalization and quantile regression,
quantification of uncertainty, and reliability in deep learning systems in
medical applications.

I hold an MSc in Biomedical Engineering and a BSc in Electrical Engineering,
both from the Technion. Previously head TA of the CS faculty's [Deep
Learning](https://vistalab-technion.github.io/cs236781/semesters/w22/) course
(2019-2022).

In addition to a my research pursuits, I have a strong technical background in
software engineering. Before starting my PhD I worked in multiple technical
roles. I have extensive experience writing robust, testable, well-designed
code, leading software teams and architecting large-scale systems.
